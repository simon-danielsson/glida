## Information
  
Having a good method of tracking what's finished and what needs to be done is crucial once a project grows large enough. Of course, for team-driven development having a full-featured issue tracker such as GitHub or similar is preferable, but for solo-developers GitHub can feel like an over-engineered solution to a simple problem.
  
My goal with Glida was to create an opinionated issue tracker that is portable between machines and requires no setup, configuration files, special folders, or a specific development environment.
  
(The name "Glida" is derived from the swedish saying "bra koll" - if someone is living their life with structure and purpose, a swedish person may say they have "bra koll".)
  
The idea for this project was inspired directly by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NdRGmp70Go).

## Install
    
``` bash
cargo install glida
```

## Usage
    
### Adding a new issue
  
The core philosophy of Glida is that issues are opened, closed and edited **inside the codebase itself**. Issues live in the codebase and are not dependent on an internet-connection, or you having to pay a subscription fee at the end of every month. When you want to add something to your issue list you simply type it out in your project, perhaps next to relevant code (tip: create a snippet for this; for example "issue").
   
``` rust
// *glida - d: fix typo in debug print, p: 10, t: debug, s: closed
fn debug() {
    println!("debugG")
}
```
  
- d: description of the issue (obligatory)
- p: priority from 0 to infinity where the highest number takes priority (optional - fallback: 0)
- t: tag (optional - fallback: n/a)
- s: status [ (op)en | (pr)ogress | (cl)osed ] (optional - fallback: open)
  
The status value can also take abbreviations (op, pr & cl).
  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> * An issue line is any line containing the prefix "*glida".
> * Everything before the prefix on an issue line is ignored by the parser.
> * Everything after the prefix is parsed as metadata.
> * Multiple tags are not supported - this is by design, to force clarity when opening issues!
  
### Workflow integration
  
Here's a way to integrate Glida into your neovim config using luasnip:
  
``` lua
local ls = require("luasnip")
local s = ls.snippet
local t = ls.text_node
local i = ls.insert_node

return {
    s("issue", {
        t("*glida - d: "), i(1),
        t(", p: "), i(2),
        t(", t: "), i(3),
        t(", s: open"),
    }),
}
```
  
Here's a way to integrate Glida into git using a bash alias:
  
``` bash
unalias commit 2>/dev/null
commit() {
    local id="$1"
    glida close $id
    glida cp $id

    if command -v pbpaste >/dev/null; then
        clip=$(pbpaste)
    elif command -v xclip >/dev/null; then
        clip=$(xclip -o -selection clipboard)
    elif command -v wl-paste >/dev/null; then
        clip=$(wl-paste)
    fi

    git add --all
    git commit -a -m "$clip"
}
```
  
**My development workflow with Glida looks like this:**  
1. Create a new issue within the codebase.  
2. When I want to work on the issue, I set its status to "in progress" either directly in the code or through the CLI.  
3. Finish working on the issue.  
4. Run command `glida` (with relevant filter flags if necessary) to find its id number.  
5. Run bash script `commit <id>` to close the issue and commit it to git.  
6. Run command `glida summary` every once in a while to track my progress.  
7. Rinse and repeat.

## Subcommands and flags
  
All the issues listed, sorted by priority and status (the current directory is scanned recursively by default):
  
``` terminal
glida
```
  
An optional target path can be added (works alongside other flags):
  
``` terminal
glida <relative path>
```
  
Filter issues by tag:
  
``` terminal
glida -t <tag>
```
  
Filter issues by status:
  
``` terminal
glida -s <status>
```
  
Filter issues by description:
  
``` terminal
glida -d <keyword>
```
  
Limit scan to shallow depth (i.e. no recursion):
  
``` terminal
glida -r
```
  
Summary of all issues:
  
``` terminal
glida summary
```
  
Copy issue details to clipboard with formatting: "tag (file:line): desc".  
This is to reduce the friction of writing git commit messages manually.   
  
``` terminal
glida copy <id>
glida cp <id>
```
  
Close issue through CLI:
  
``` terminal
glida closed <id>
glida close <id>
glida cl <id>
```
  
Open issue through CLI:
  
``` terminal
glida open <id>
glida op <id>
```

Progress issue through CLI:
  
``` terminal
glida prog <id>
glida pr <id>
glida progress <id>
```
  
  
Display help and version information:
  
``` terminal
glida help
```
